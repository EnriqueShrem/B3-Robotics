# Future Work

## End Effector Development
Conventional end-effectors such as grippers and vacuum nozzles will not be suitable for the robot movements nor capable of realizing the proposed tasks such as liquid pouring, flask handeling, pick and place, etc. Therefore a development of custom end-effector will be necessary.

## Self-Collision Avoidance
Constrains must be imposed to the robot controller and/or mechanism to prevent the robot from self-collision.

## Mechanism and Mechanical Advantage
A mechanism must be added to the robot design to mechanically allow its movement, also if a payload is desired a mechanical advantage mechanism such as gears trains should be implemented.
