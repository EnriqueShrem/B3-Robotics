## Payload Estimation 
Each link must be able to withstand the stresses that are imposed by the payload.  

Apply the bending stress equation to each link:  

$$\sigma = \frac{M \cdot c}{I}$$

σ: Bending stress in the link (Pa).  
𝑀: Bending moment due to payload and link mass.  
𝑐: Distance from the neutral axis to the outermost fiber (depends on link cross-section).  
𝐼: Second moment of area of the link cross-section.  

The bending stress 𝜎 must not exceed the yield strength of the link material:  
𝜎 ≤ 𝜎yield
